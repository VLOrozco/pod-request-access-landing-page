## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, Flexbox & Grid
- JavaScript | Form : Email address validation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the RegExp sequence of characters and assertions used to search a pattern, in this project's example: an email validation form, within a users input. I learned that **Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data**. This has piqued my interest in learning more on how to build RegExp patterns!

### Continued development

My main focus is to continue building projects to practice my coding skills with JavaScript & React with Redux.

I will also do further research to learning more characters to create Regular Expression patterns to use in a variety of form types and for making searching and matching of strings efficient in search engines and logs.
